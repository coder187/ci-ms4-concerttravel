## Surface

### Design
  * Colour Scheme	
    I chose black/green/yellow combinations as this matches well with the exisitng concert-travel business logo.
  * Typography
    Lato and Sora google fonts. Sora stood out as a good poster type font which suits the sites style of concert posters.
   * Imagery
    Hero images taken from google images of various scenes of crowds of people at concerts with translucent hints of blue, purle and yellow.
    Imaged fot event cards are comprised of Event/Artist promotional media combined with the site concer-travel main "peace" logo with yellow green concert scene.
